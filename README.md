# Redshift for R

Provides a few functions to make it easier to access [Amazon's Redshift](http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) service from R.

This library essentially does very little, other than provide some nicer functions that use the [RJDBC](http://www.rforge.net/RJDBC/index.html) package. The code includes by default the Postgresql 8.4-703 JDBC driver that is required for connecting to Amazon's Redshift service; installing this package would install all dependencies necessary to start querying and analysing. However, custom Postgresql drivers can be used (like later versions of the driver).

## Installing

[Download the latest code tarball](https://github.com/pingles/redshift-r/archive/master.zip). Unzip the archive and run the following command in R:

    install.packages("/Users/me/Downloads/redshift-r-master", dependencies=T, repos=NULL, type="source")

## Usage
    require(redshift)
    
    conn <- redshift.connect("jdbc:postgresql://blah.blah.eu-west-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/data", "username", "password")
    # conn is just a regular RJDBC connection object

    # we can retrieve a list of tables
    tables <- redshift.tables(conn)

    # and get some info about the columns in one of those tables
    cols <- redshift.columns(conn, "weblog")

    # we can use RJDBC dbGetQuery to retrieve query results, perhaps from our weblog data
    statuses_by_day <- dbGetQuery(conn, paste("SELECT DATE(timestamp) as dated, status, COUNT(1) as request_count",
                                              "FROM weblog",
                                              "GROUP BY DATE(time_stamp), status",
                                              "ORDER BY dated"))
    statuses_by_day$dated <- as.Date(statuses_by_day$dated)
    statuses_by_day$status <- as.factor(statuses_by_day$status)

    # finally, lets do a little scatter plot to see how this looks
    require(ggplot2)
    p <- ggplot(statuses_by_day, aes(x=dated, y=request_count))
    p + geom_point(aes(color=status))

## Checking package

Before committing changes to the project you can run the following command from the directory containing the cloned repo (i.e. `./redshift/..`)

    $ R CMD check redshift

## To Do

* Update R documentation with functions- generates warnings during check at the moment.
